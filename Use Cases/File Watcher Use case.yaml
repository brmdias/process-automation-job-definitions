  description: "Use case to execute a series of steps based in a condition. If not,\
    \ exit gracefully.\n\nStep1 - This step will execute a If condition using power\
    \ shell script. \nIf the condition evaluates to true, then it moves to next set\
    \ of steps (2 to 10) and executes all of them in sequence.\nIf the condition evaluates\
    \ to false, it should halt the execution and should not execute next set of steps.\
    \ Now we don’t want the job to be failed even in this scenario, and Rundeck should\
    \ not interpret this as failure. \n\nTo handle this I have tried adding error\
    \ handler to Step1. \nThe else condition in Step1 has exit 1 code and is managed\
    \ by error handler. however Though I use exit 0 in error handler, the execution\
    \ is moving to the subsequent steps without halting execution.\n\nIllustrative\
    \ example\n\n Step 1\n\n If (condition )\n{\necho \" all ok\"\nexit 0\n}else {\n\
    exit 1 \n}\n\nError Handler Step 1\n\n exit 0\n\n "
