If not, exit gracefully.\n\nStep1 - This step will execute a If condition using power shell script. \nIf the condition evaluates to true, then it moves to next set of steps (2 to 10) and executes all of them in sequence.\nIf the condition evaluates to false, it should halt the execution and should not execute next set of steps. Now we donâ€™t want the job to be failed even in this scenario, and Rundeck should not interpret this as failure. \n\nTo handle this I have tried adding error handler to Step1. \nThe else condition in Step1 has exit 1 code and is managed by error handler. however Though I use exit 0 in error handler, the execution is moving to the subsequent steps without halting execution.\n\nIllustrative example\n\n Step 1\n\n If (condition )\n{\necho \" all ok\"\nexit 0\n}else {\nexit 1 \n}\n\nError Handler Step 1\n\n exit 0\n\n ",
