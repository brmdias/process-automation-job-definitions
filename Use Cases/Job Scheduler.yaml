  description: " \n## Objective\nThis job will change the owner of a job to a different\
    \ user. This is done using RBA API by exporting and importing the job definition\
    \ without any changes. \n\nIt will then change the job owner to the user account\
    \ associated to the token used for export/import.\n\nThis can be helpful when\
    \ you want to use a specific local account to manage all job schedules. This will\
    \ avoid a job schedule to become orphan when a user is removed from RBA.\n\n##\
    \ Requirements\n- Python installed\n- User RBA API Token available in the Key\
    \ Storage under path: `keys/users/[USERNAME]/rba-api-token`\n    - If you're following\
    \ a different naming convention, edit the job and change the option `user-account-token`\
    \ default value.\n\n## How to use this\n1. Make sure you have your users RBA API\
    \ tokens created under the path `keys/users/[USERNAME]/rba-api-token` or other\
    \ path convention defined in job option `user-account-token`.\n2. Run the job\
    \ with option values:\n    1. Job ID: ID of the job to get a new owner\n    2.\
    \ User Account: Username of the new owner of the jobs\n"
